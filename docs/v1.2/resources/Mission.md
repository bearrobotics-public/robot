[Missions](../../concepts/mission.md#missions) are atomic units of behavior that define a robot's high-level actions.
This API enables you to control robot behavior—from simple navigation
tasks to complex, conditional workflows.

### Errors
| ErrorCode  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `FAILED_PRECONDITION`   | The robot is already executing another mission. CreateMissionWorkflow is only valid when there is no running mission on the robot, with its state in one of the [terminal states](#state-enum), i.e., Cancelled, Succeeded, Failed, Default. |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT`    | The client supplied a request with invalid format.

### Request / Response
!!! note
    AppendMission request and response message types are the same as [CreateMission](#createmission). See [CreateMission JSON Examples](#json-request-example).

### Errors
| ErrorCode  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
|`FAILED_PRECONDITION`   |  There is no mission in the mission queue. Client should first create the initial mission, and only use Append for queuing additional missions. |
|`INVALID_ARGUMENT`    |   The client supplied a request with invalid format. This covers sending empty requests, invalid goals, goals that do not match mission type, and other format errors. Client should update their usage to have correctly formatted requests with valid goals for the missions as defined in documentation. |
|`INTERNAL`    |   The request failed to execute due to internal error in mission system. Client should retry appending the mission. |
|`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`    |  The request was accepted but timed out waiting for the robot to confirm. Client should retry appending the mission. |

-----------
## ChargeRobot
`ChargeRobot` is a special type of mission. Use this command to instruct the robot to begin charging, regardless of its current battery level. This command is only supported on robots equipped with a contact-based charging dock.
You can use [`SubscribeRobotStatus`](RobotStatus.md#subscriberobotstatus) to monitor the charging process.

### Request

This request takes no fields.

##### JSON Request Example
=== "JSON"
    ```js
    {}
    ```

    {
      "missionId": "mission-xyz-001"
    }
    ```

### Errors

|`FAILED_PRECONDITION`   |  The robot is already executing a mission. The current mission must be canceled before issuing this command. |
|`NOT_FOUND`    |  The robot's map has no charging location configured (no contact-charger destination). |
|`INTERNAL`    |   The request failed to execute due to internal error in mission system. Client should retry creating the mission.
|`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`    |  The request was accepted but timed out waiting for the robot to confirm. Client should retry creating the mission. |
