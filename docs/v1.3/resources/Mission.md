[Missions](../../concepts/mission.md#missions) are atomic units of behavior that define a robot's high-level actions.
This API enables you to control robot behavior—from simple navigation
tasks to complex, conditional workflows.

------------
## CreateMission
Create a mission of the specified type.
<br/>

### Request

##### mission `Mission` `required`

          }
        }
      }
    ```

### Response

##### **mission_id** `string`
The ID of the mission created.

##### Response Example
=== "JSON"
    ```json
      {
        "missionId": "cbd47ab1-df21-479e-9f72-677b81ab55b0"
      }
    ```

### Errors
| ErrorCode  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
|`FAILED_PRECONDITION`   |  The robot is already executing another mission, or another mission is queued. `CreateMission` is only valid if there is no running or queued mission on the robot, with its state in one of the [terminal states](#state-enum), i.e., Cancelled, Succeeded, Failed, Default. |
|`INVALID_ARGUMENT`    |   The client supplied a request with invalid format. This covers sending empty requests, invalid goals, goals that do not match mission type, and other format errors. Client should update their usage to have correctly formatted requests with valid goals for the missions as defined in documentation. |
|`INTERNAL`    |   The request failed to execute due to internal error in mission system. Client should retry creating the mission.
|`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`    |  The request was accepted but timed out waiting for the robot to confirm. Client should retry creating the mission. |

-----------
## CreateMissionBatch
Atomically create multiple missions in a single request. The created missions
are queued contiguously in the order they appear in the request, and the
returned mission IDs match that order.

!!! note
    This call is **atomic**: if any mission in the batch fails validation or
    creation, **no** missions are created.

### Request

##### missions `repeated CreateMissionRequest` `required`
The list of missions to create, in execution order. Each entry is a
[`CreateMissionRequest`](#createmission), wrapping a single
[`Mission`](#createmission). Only one [mission type](../../concepts/mission.md#mission-types)
may be set per entry.

##### Request Example
=== "JSON"
    ```json
      {
        "missions": [
          {
            "mission": {
              "baseMission": {
                "navigateMission": {
                  "goal": { "destinationId": "pickup_zone" }
                }
              }
            }
          },
          {
            "mission": {
              "baseMission": {
                "navigateMission": {
                  "goal": { "destinationId": "drop_zone" }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ```

### Response

##### **mission_ids** `repeated string`
The IDs of the missions created, in the same order as the request.

##### Response Example
=== "JSON"
    ```json
      {
        "missionIds": [
          "cbd47ab1-df21-479e-9f72-677b81ab55b0",
          "d6637a14-5f6b-43f6-bd86-cc1871a8322e"
        ]
      }
    ```

### Errors
| ErrorCode  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
|`FAILED_PRECONDITION`   |  Another mission is running or queued, or the robot is unable to start a mission. `CreateMissionBatch` is only valid if there is no running or queued mission on the robot. |
|`INVALID_ARGUMENT`    |   The client supplied a request with invalid format. This covers empty requests, an empty `missions` list, invalid goals, goals that do not match mission type, and other format errors. Since the call is atomic, a single invalid mission causes the entire batch to be rejected. |
|`INTERNAL`    |   The request failed to execute due to internal error in mission system. Client should retry creating the batch.
|`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`    |  The request was accepted but timed out waiting for the robot to confirm. Client should retry creating the batch. |

-----------

      }
    ```

### Errors
| ErrorCode  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `FAILED_PRECONDITION`   | The robot is already executing another mission. CreateMissionWorkflow is only valid when there is no running mission on the robot, with its state in one of the [terminal states](#state-enum), i.e., Cancelled, Succeeded, Failed, Default. |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT`    | The client supplied a request with invalid format. This covers a missing or invalid `mission_workflow`, workflow type not set to ServiWorkflow or CartiWorkflow, or a workflow type not supported for the robot's family. Client should update their usage to have a correctly formatted request. |
| `INTERNAL`    | The request failed to execute due to internal error in mission system. Client should retry creating the workflow. |
| `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` | The request was accepted but timed out waiting for the robot to confirm. Client should retry creating the workflow. |

-----------
## AppendMission
Appends a mission to the end of the [mission queue](../../concepts/mission.md#mission-queue).
Use this when a mission is currently running; otherwise, prefer [CreateMission](#createmission).
Missions are executed in the order they are appended.

### Request / Response
!!! note
    AppendMission request and response message types are the same as [CreateMission](#createmission). See the [CreateMission Request Example](#request-example).

### Errors
| ErrorCode  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
|`FAILED_PRECONDITION`   |  There is no mission in the mission queue. Client should first create the initial mission, and only use Append for queuing additional missions. |
|`INVALID_ARGUMENT`    |   The client supplied a request with invalid format. This covers sending empty requests, invalid goals, goals that do not match mission type, and other format errors. Client should update their usage to have correctly formatted requests with valid goals for the missions as defined in documentation. |
|`INTERNAL`    |   The request failed to execute due to internal error in mission system. Client should retry appending the mission. |
|`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`    |  The request was accepted but timed out waiting for the robot to confirm. Client should retry appending the mission. |

-----------
## AppendMissionBatch
Atomically append multiple missions to the end of the [mission queue](../../concepts/mission.md#mission-queue).
All missions are appended contiguously in the request order. Missions can be
appended even when other missions are already queued.

!!! note
    This call is **atomic**: if any mission in the batch fails validation or
    append, **no** missions are appended.

### Request

##### missions `repeated AppendMissionRequest` `required`

        ]
      }
    ```

### Errors
| ErrorCode  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
|`FAILED_PRECONDITION`   |  There is no mission in the mission queue. Client should first create the initial mission, and only use Append (or AppendBatch) for queuing additional missions. |
|`INVALID_ARGUMENT`    |   The client supplied a request with invalid format. This covers empty requests, an empty `missions` list, invalid goals, goals that do not match mission type, and other format errors. Since the call is atomic, a single invalid mission causes the entire batch to be rejected. |
|`INTERNAL`    |   The request failed to execute due to internal error in mission system. Client should retry appending the batch. |
|`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`    |  The request was accepted but timed out waiting for the robot to confirm. Client should retry appending the batch. |

## ChargeRobot
`ChargeRobot` is a special type of mission. Use this command to instruct the robot to begin charging, regardless of its current battery level. This command is only supported on robots equipped with a contact-based charging dock.
You can use [`SubscribeRobotStatus`](RobotStatus.md#subscriberobotstatus) to monitor the charging process.

This request takes no fields.

##### Request Example
=== "JSON"
    ```json
    {}
    ```

      "missionId": "mission-xyz-001"
    }
    ```

### Errors

| ErrorCode  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
|`FAILED_PRECONDITION`   |  The robot is already executing a mission. The current mission must be canceled before issuing this command. |
|`NOT_FOUND`    |  The robot's map has no charging location configured (no contact-charger destination). |
|`INTERNAL`    |   The request failed to execute due to internal error in mission system. Client should retry creating the mission.
|`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`    |  The request was accepted but timed out waiting for the robot to confirm. Client should retry creating the mission. |

-----------

| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | The client supplied a request with invalid format. |
| `INTERNAL` | The request failed to execute due to internal error in mission system. Client should retry. |

-----------
## UpdateMission
Issues a command to control or update the current mission (e.g., pause, cancel).
!!! warning
